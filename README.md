# Plutus Project Template

Template repository of a Plutus Project.

This templte project sturcture also specifies how to store and structure the source code and report of a standard Plutus Project.

This `README.md` file serves as an example how a this will look like in a standard Plutus project. Below listed out the sample section.

## Abstract
- Summarize the project: motivation, methods, findings, etc. 

## Introduction
- Briefly introduce the project.
- Problem statement, research question or the hypothesis.
- Method(s) to solve the problem
- What are the results?

## Related Work (or Background)
- Prerequisite reading if the audience needs knowledge before exploring the project.
- Optional

## Trading (Algorithm) Hypotheses
- Describe the Trading Hypotheses
- Step 1 of the Nine-Step

## Data
- Data source
- Data type
- Data period
- How to get the input data?
- How to store the output data?
### Data collection
- Step 2 of the Nine-Step
### Data Processing
- Step 3 of the Nine-Step

## Implementation
- Briefly describe the implemetation.
    - How to set up the enviroment to run the source code and required steps to replicate the results
    - Discuss the concrete implementation if there are any essential details
    - How to run each step from `In-sample Backtesting`, Step 4 to `Out-of-sample Backtesting`, Step 6 (or `Paper Trading`, Step 7).
    - How to change the algorithm configurations for different run.
- Most important section and need the most details to correctly replicate the results.

## In-sample Backtesting
- Describe the In-sample Backtesting step
    - Parameters
    - Data
- Step 4 of the Nine-Step
### In-sample Backtesting Result
- Brieftly shown the result: table, image, etc.
- Has link to the In-sample Backtesting Report

## Optimization
- Describe the Optimization step
    - Optimization process/methods/library
    - Parameters to optimize
    - Hyper-parameter of the optimize process
- Step 5 of the Nine-Step
### Optimization Result
- Brieftly shown the result: table, image, etc.
- Has link to the Optimization Report

## Out-of-sample Backtesting
- Describe the Out-of-sample Backtesting step
    - Parameter
    - Data
- Step 6 of th Nine-Step
### Out-of-sample Backtesting Reuslt
- Brieftly shown the result: table, image, etc.
- Has link to the Out-of-sample Backtesting Report

## Paper Trading
- Describe the Paper Trading step
- Step 7 of the Nine-Step
- Optional
### Optimization Result
- Brieftly shown the result: table, image, etc.
- Has link to the Paper Trading Report


## Conclusion
- What is the conclusion?
- Optional

## Reference
- All the reference goes here.

## Other information
- Link to the Final Report (Paper) should be somewhere in the `README.md` file.
- Please make sure this file is relatively easy to follow.
